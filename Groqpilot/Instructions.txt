❗Note:

**You Cannot use two system roles in 1 chat, 1 chat means 1 system role,
 
     for example if you set system role to "Talk as hulk" it will only talk as hulk during the whole chat
     even if you change it to something like "Ironman". So, if you want to create another system_role, just do it in a new chat by clicking on the start_new_chat option.**

**If you use system_role don't forget to click on the start_new_chat because when the application loads the model is loaded into default chat_history with default role.
  So as you know only 1 system_role works in 1 chat. If you don't click on the start_new_chat the chat history will be saved in the default directory that is chat_history.json.**

**Use the Update_chat_list after creating a new_chat to load it in the dropdown.**

**You can check the terminal to see where your chats are being saved.**

**Remember to Untick❌ the Start New Chator else it will keep on creating new chat's, basically to continue the chat just select the chat from the List and Untick the Start new chat.**
