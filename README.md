# Groqpilot

Groqpilot is an application which uses Groq-API to help you run Large language models, on your local computer without a gpu or a high end system requirement. This application will save you tons of storage space and since all the inference is handled through Groq-API, so its really really fast in terms of content/text generation.

This repository primarily provides a Gradio GUI and additional features to run Groq Models.
